# Hi, I'm Yesmer Castrillo 👋
I am a young programming lover who wants to contribute to the community and society, with technologies that can help facilitate exhaustive and repetitive tasks of our daily lives.

I really like web development and I keep learning new things constantly to improve every day as a programmer, so my expectations are to build my learning

## Right now I'm getting rid of myself in:
* constantly learning
* creating personal projects to develop my experience
* studying systems engineering for a degree
* improving my english skills

## My skills
